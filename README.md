single-file public-facing TiddlyWiki as a digital garden &amp; work repository

## 🌱 🌿 🌳 🍏

A digital garden (or knowledge garden/mind garden) can be a notebook, a blog, a wiki, a journal, a research document … anything that aids you in developing and cultivating a bidirectional, non-linear note repository that encourages networked thinking, which can useful for building a knowledge base for learning in real-time. Digital gardens can be considered Tools for Thought (TfT), a type of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), or a Knowledge Graph.

➞ intention & plans for gavart.ist

This wiki is built using the TiddlyWiki platform and the original intention was to create an up-to-date archive of my self-released music works and performances. As I became more fascinated by the philosophy and potential of TiddlyWiki I began branching out (🌿) and using it to store my reading log/notes and essays/reviews I've written. From there it grew further (🌳) to include Music Score PDFs, Software Notes & Code examples as well as a list of piano pieces that I have learned.

Moving forward, I would like to incorporate research and development for several Works in Progress; start using is as a written personal Journal; include a Photo Journal; expand the Friends & Family section; and in the spirit of the sentiments expressed in The Small Website Discoverability Crisis, start linking to interesting Bookmarks that I come across on the web. The purpose of all of this will be to continue to cultivate a general feeling of awe, satisfy my inner-archivist, maintain a system for storing information, and to discover the ways in which knowledge can be networked together for simple and interesting future retrieval.
